You collected a large number of texts and think it is a good idea to summarize your corpus into several textual sentiment time series, which you ponder could help predicting some variable you are interested in. However, you do not really know how to proceed next... Fortunately, you come across the **sentometrics** package, which does exactly what you need! Great!

## The R package **sentometrics**: What?

The **sentometrics** package is an **integrated framework for textual sentiment time series aggregation and prediction**. It accounts for the intrinsic challenge that textual sentiment can be computed in many different ways, as well as the large number of possibilities to pool sentiment into a time series index. The package therefore integrates the fast _quantification_ of sentiment from texts, the _aggregation_ into different sentiment time series and the _prediction_ based on these measures. All in one coherent workflow!

### For you to read

Our [vignette](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3067734) explains the ins and outs of the software package, and has an accompanying code example (see the `run_vignette.R` script under the _/examples_ folder on our GitHub repository). The complete documentation can be found on CRAN's [sentometrics](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sentometrics) page. 

## Installation

To install the latest package version from CRAN, simply do:

```

When installed, you are ready to load the package...

```R
library("sentometrics")
```

... and have some fun! 

## Many and more examples

Here follow a bunch of examples, from simple to a little less simple. Sentiment computation, aggregation, diagnostic tools, visualization, regression -- it's all in here.

### _**Example 1:**_ ready-to-use sentiment calculation

A simple calculation of sentiment. The score is a substraction of the number of negative lexicon words (those with a score of -1) from the number of positive lexicon words (those with a score of 1).

```R
library("sentometrics")

data("usnews")

s <- compute_sentiment(
  sentometrics::usnews[["texts"]],
  sento_lexicons(sentometrics::list_lexicons[c("GI_en", "LM_en")]),
  how = "counts"
)
```

### _**Example 2:**_ sentiment calculation from a `sento_corpus` object 

The same simple calculation as in Example 1, but using a `sento_corpus` object.

```R
library("sentometrics")

data("usnews")

corpus <- sento_corpus(usnews)
lexicons <- sento_lexicons(sentometrics::list_lexicons[c("GI_en", "LM_en", "HENRY_en")])

s <- compute_sentiment(corpus, lexicons, how = "counts")
```

### _**Example 3:**_ sentiment calculation from a **tm** `SimpleCorpus` object

Again, a simple textual sentiment calculation, but this time using a **tm** package corpus object. Super flexible! The output is this time slightly different, as the scores are divided by the total number of words.

```R
library("sentometrics")
library("tm")

data("usnews")

corpus <- SimpleCorpus(VectorSource(usnews[["texts"]]))
lexicons <- sento_lexicons(sentometrics::list_lexicons[c("GI_en", "LM_en", "HENRY_en")])

s <- compute_sentiment(corpus, lexicons, how = "proportional")
```

### _**Example 4:**_ sentiment calculation from own tokenization

Even more flexibility in this example! You tokenize your corpus outside the sentiment computation function call, so you control exactly which words the lexicons are going to look into.

```R
library("sentometrics")
library("quanteda")

data("usnews")

corpus <- sento_corpus(usnews)
lexicons <- sento_lexicons(sentometrics::list_lexicons[c("GI_en", "LM_en", "HENRY_en")])

tks <- as.list(tokens(corpus, what = "fastestword"))

s <- compute_sentiment(corpus, lexicons, how = "counts", tokens = tks)
```

### _**Example 5:**_ sentence-level sentiment calculation and aggregation

A textual sentiment computation on sentence-level, starting from a document-level corpus, and normalized dividing by the number of detected polarized words. Subsequently, the resulting sentence-level scores are aggregated into document-level scores.

```R
library("sentometrics")
library("quanteda")

data("usnews")

corpus <- sento_corpus(usnews[, 1:3])

s <- compute_sentiment(
  corpus,
  sento_lexicons(sentometrics::list_lexicons[c("GI_en", "LM_en")]),
  how = "proportionalPol",
  do.sentence = TRUE
)

sDocs <- aggregate(s, ctr_agg(howDocs = "proportional"), do.full = FALSE)
```

From these sentiment scores, we find and display the 7 documents where most positive sentiment scores were detected.

```R
peakDocsPos <- peakdocs(sDocs, n = 7, type = "pos")
corpusPeaks <- corpus_subset(corpus, docnames(corpus) %in% peakDocsPos)
texts(corpusPeaks)
```

### _**Example 6:**_ document-level sentiment aggregation into time series

To aggregate document-level sentiment scores into time series only requires to specificy a few parameters regarding the weighting and the time frequency.

```R
library("sentometrics")

data("usnews")

corpus <- sento_corpus(usnews)

s <- compute_sentiment(
  corpus,
  sento_lexicons(sentometrics::list_lexicons[c("GI_en", "LM_en")]),
  how = "counts"
)

ctr <- ctr_agg(howDocs = "proportional",
               howTime = "equal_weight", by = "month", lag = 6)
measures <- aggregate(s, ctr)
```

The obtained measures can be plotted, all of them, or according to the three time series dimensions (the corpus features, the lexicons and the time weighting schemes).

```R
plot(measures)
plot(measures, "features")
plot(measures, "lexicons")
plot(measures, "time")
```

### _**Example 7:**_ document-level sentiment aggregation into time series (bis)

The aggregation into sentiment time series does not have to be done in two steps. Below one-step approach is recommended because very easy!

```R
library("sentometrics")
library("data.table")

data("usnews")

corpus <- sento_corpus(usnews)
lexicons <- sento_lexicons(sentometrics::list_lexicons[c("GI_en", "LM_en", "HENRY_en")])
ctr <- ctr_agg(howWithin = "counts",
               howDocs = "proportional",
               howTime = "linear", by = "week", lag = 14)

measures <- sento_measures(corpus, lexicons, ctr)
```

Similar to extracting the peak documents in a sentiment table, we extract here the peak dates in the sentiment time series matrix. Detected below are the 5 dates where average sentiment across all sentiment measures is lowest.

```R
peakDatesNeg <- peakdates(measures, n = 5, type = "neg", do.average = TRUE)
dtPeaks <- as.data.table(subset(measures, date %in% peakDatesNeg))
```

### _**Example 8:**_ sentiment time series aggregation

Sentiment measures can be further aggregated across any of the three dimensions. The computed time series are averages across the relevant measures.

```R
library("sentometrics")

data("usnews")

corpus <- sento_corpus(usnews)
lexicons <- sento_lexicons(sentometrics::list_lexicons[c("GI_en", "LM_en", "HENRY_en")])
ctr <- ctr_agg(howWithin = "counts",
               howDocs = "proportional",
               howTime = c("linear", "equal_weight"), by = "week", lag = 14)

measures <- sento_measures(corpus, lexicons, ctr)

measuresAgg <- aggregate(measures,
                         features = list("journal" = c("wsj", "wapo")),
                         time = list("linequal" = c("linear", "equal_weight")))

get_dimensions(measuresAgg) # inspect the contents of the three dimensions
```

### _**Example 9:**_ sentiment time series aggregation (bis)

To keep it at its simplest, all the sentiment measures computed can be condensed in a few global sentiment time series. The computation can be run in a weighted way as well.  

```R
library("sentometrics")
library("data.table")
library("ggplot2")

data("usnews")

corpus <- sento_corpus(usnews)
lexicons <- sento_lexicons(sentometrics::list_lexicons[c("GI_en", "LM_en", "HENRY_en")])
ctr <- ctr_agg(howWithin = "counts",
               howDocs = "proportional",
               howTime = c("linear", "equal_weight"), by = "week", lag = 14)

measures <- sento_measures(corpus, lexicons, ctr)

measuresGlobal <- aggregate(measures, do.global = TRUE)
```

The output in this case is not a specific **sentometrics** `sento_measures` object, but simply a `data.table` object. Below produces a nice plot using the **ggplot2** package.

```R
ggplot(melt(measuresGlobal, id.vars = "date")) +
  aes(x = date, y = value, color = variable) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_date(name = "Date", date_labels = "%m-%Y") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Sentiment") +
  theme_bw() + 
  sentometrics:::plot_theme(legendPos = "top") # a small trick to finetune the plotting display
```

### _**Example 10:**_ tf-idf sentiment calculation as in the **quanteda** package

The term frequency-inverse document frequency statistic is widely used to quantify term importance in a corpus. Its use extends to sentiment calculation simply by adding the polarity of the words to the equation. This example shows that the tf-idf sentiment output from **sentometrics** is the same as the output obtained using the text mining package **quanteda**.

```R
library("sentometrics")
library("quanteda")
library("stringi")

# ensure same tokenization for full comparability
txts <- sentometrics::usnews$texts[1:100]
toks <- stri_split_boundaries(stri_trans_tolower(txts), type = "word", skip_word_none = TRUE)

# pick a lexicon
lexIn <- sentometrics::list_lexicons$GI_en

### quanteda tf-idf sentiment calculation ###
toksQ <- as.tokens(toks)
dfmQ <- dfm(toksQ) %>% dfm_tfidf(k = 1)

posWords <- lexIn[y == 1, x]
negWords <- lexIn[y == -1, x]

posScores <- rowSums(dfm_select(dfmQ, posWords))
negScores <- rowSums(dfm_select(dfmQ, negWords))
q <- unname(posScores - negScores)

### sentometrics tf-idf sentiment calculation ###
lex <- sento_lexicons(list(L = lexIn))
s <- compute_sentiment(txts, lex, tokens = toks, "TFIDF")[["L"]]
```

_R_ they equal (using the **testthat** package)?

```R
testthat::expect_equal(q, s)
```

### _**Example 11:**_ comparing the three key approaches to the sentiment computation

We offer three main approaches to do the lexicon-based sentiment calculation: account only for unigrams _(simple)_, consider valence shifting in a bigrams perspective _(valence)_, or consider valence shifting in a cluster of words around a detected polarized word _(cluster)_. Read the [vignette](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3067734) for more details! Here we demonstrate how to plot the different approaches for comparison.

```R
library("sentometrics")
library("lexicon")

data("usnews")
txts <- usnews[1:200, "texts"]

data("list_valence_shifters")
vals <- list_valence_shifters[["en"]]

lexValence <- sento_lexicons(list(nrc = lexicon::hash_sentiment_nrc), vals[, c("x", "y")])
lexCluster <- sento_lexicons(list(nrc = lexicon::hash_sentiment_nrc), vals[, c("x", "t")])

s1 <- compute_sentiment(txts, head(lexValence, -1))$nrc
s2 <- compute_sentiment(txts, lexValence)$nrc
s3 <- compute_sentiment(txts, lexCluster)$nrc
s <- cbind(simple = s1, valence = s2, cluster = s3)

matplot(s, type = "l", lty = 1, ylab = "Sentiment", xlab = "Document")
legend("topright", col = 1:3, legend = colnames(s), lty = 1, cex = 0.7)
```

### _**Example 12:**_ summarizing a corpus through some statistics and plots

Quickly investigate how your corpus looks like in terms of number of documents, number of tokens and its metadata features.

```R
library("sentometrics")

data("usnews")

corpus <- sento_corpus(usnews)

summ1 <- corpus_summarize(corpus, by = "week")
summ1[["stats"]] # some weekly corpus statistics about tokens and features

summ2 <- corpus_summarize(corpus, by = "year", features = c("wsj", "wapo"))
plots <- summ2[["plots"]]
plots$doc_plot # yearly evolution of the number of documents
plots$feature_plot # yearly evolution of the presence of the "wsj" and "wapo" features
plots$token_plot # yearly evolution of the token statistics (mean, min., max.)
```
