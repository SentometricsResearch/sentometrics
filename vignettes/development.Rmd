Overview of anticipated developments and known bugs or unfinished business. If you want to help out on some of these things, contact the maintainer, or file a pull request on GitHub.

### Extensions

- Implement a `sento_train()` function to for instance generate a lexicon from a corpus.

- Add straightforward topic modelling functionality into the `add_features()` function (or as part of the `sento_train()` function).

- Expand the number of available models in the `sento_model()` function (e.g. constrained regression, and PCA).

- Implement an optimization approach into the `aggregate.sento_measures(..., do.global = TRUE)` function to extract optimized weights across dimensions (make it possibly available through the `sento_model()` function); this includes allowing weights to be set in the `aggregate.sento_measures()` function instead of averaging by default.

- Implement fast textual sentiment computation for lexicons with ngrams.

- Implement a `scale.sentiment()` function.

- Add a `head.sento_measures()` and a `tail.sento_measures()` function.

- Implement a structure to support high-frequency intraday aggregation.

- Make more lexicons available (e.g. German and Spanish).

- Give more control to the user to play with **`glmnet`** parameters in the `sento_model()` function.

- Write a helper function to aggregate an `attributions` object into clusters.

- Resolve inconsistency with `data.frame` input columns (`"text(s)"` & `"(doc_)id"`) in the **`sentometrics`**, **`quanteda`** and **`tm`** corpus creators.

- Prepare functional CRAN version of **`sentometrics.app`** package.

- Find additional computational speed gains (especially after recent additions which introduced some overhead).

- Add a `"binary"` option to `get_hows()[["words"]]` that turns the sentiment computation into an indicator-like calculation (value of 1 if a text has at least one lexicon word).

### Tweaks and bugs

- Optimize parallelization of iterative model runs (e.g. avoid unnecessary copying of objects across cores).

- Add a `delete_features()` function as an intuitive counterpart to `add_features()`.

- Solve issue that column names of sentiment measures output do not deal well with weird characters (e.g. Ã©) but still get through.

- Handle `data.frame` and `matrix` input in `sento_model(..., y, ...)` function more consistently.

- Add references to external **`textdata`** package in examples (e.g. for extra lexicons).

- Be more flexible for the features in a `sento_corpus` object by also allowing values outside 0 and 1.

- Make sure subsetting does not maintain a `sentiment` object when it is not supposed to be.

- Drop horizontal 0-line automatically added in the `plot.sento_measures()` function (and maybe other plot functions) as it distorts graphs of time series with values far away from 0.

- Remove all but one (not all) duplicate entries in the `sento_lexicons()` function.
