This tutorial provides a guide on how to flexibly aggregate a qualitative corpus into many time series indices.

##### Preparation

```{r}
library("sentometrics")
library("ggplot2")
library("data.table")

data("usnews")
data("list_lexicons")
data("list_valence_shifters")
```

### Document-level sentiment aggregation into time series

To aggregate document-level sentiment scores into time series requires only to specify a few parameters regarding the weighting and the time frequency.

```{r}
corpus <- sento_corpus(usnews)

s <- compute_sentiment(
  corpus,
  sento_lexicons(list_lexicons[c("GI_en", "LM_en")]),
  how = "counts"
)

ctr <- ctr_agg(howDocs = "proportional",
               howTime = "equal_weight", by = "month", lag = 6)
measures <- aggregate(s, ctr)
```

The obtained measures can be plotted, all of them, or according to the three time series dimensions (the corpus features, the lexicons and the time weighting schemes).

```{r}
plot(measures)
plot(measures, "features")
plot(measures, "lexicons")
plot(measures, "time")
```

### Document-level sentiment aggregation into time series (bis)

The aggregation into sentiment time series does not have to be done in two steps. Below one-step approach is recommended because very easy!

```{r}
corpus <- sento_corpus(usnews)
lexicons <- sento_lexicons(list_lexicons[c("GI_en", "LM_en", "HENRY_en")])
ctr <- ctr_agg(howWithin = "counts",
               howDocs = "proportional",
               howTime = "linear", by = "week", lag = 14)

measures <- sento_measures(corpus, lexicons, ctr)
measures
```

Similar to extracting the peak documents in a sentiment table, we extract here the peak dates in the sentiment time series matrix. Detected below are the 5 dates where average sentiment across all sentiment measures is lowest.

```{r}
peakDatesNeg <- peakdates(measures, n = 5, type = "neg", do.average = TRUE)
```

```{r}
dtPeaks <- as.data.table(subset(measures, date %in% peakDatesNeg))
data.table(dtPeaks[, "date"], avg = rowMeans(dtPeaks[, -1]))
```

### Sentiment aggregation into time series

Sentiment measures can be further aggregated across any of the three dimensions. The computed time series are averages across the relevant measures.

```{r}
corpus <- sento_corpus(usnews)
lexicons <- sento_lexicons(list_lexicons[c("GI_en", "LM_en", "HENRY_en")])
ctr <- ctr_agg(howWithin = "counts",
               howDocs = "proportional",
               howTime = c("linear", "equal_weight"), by = "week", lag = 14)

measures <- sento_measures(corpus, lexicons, ctr)

measuresAgg <- aggregate(measures,
                         features = list("journal" = c("wsj", "wapo")),
                         time = list("linequal" = c("linear", "equal_weight")))

get_dimensions(measuresAgg) # inspect the contents of the three dimensions
```

### Sentiment aggregation into time series (bis)

To keep it at its simplest, all the sentiment measures computed can be condensed in a few global sentiment time series. The computation can be run in a weighted way as well.  

```{r}
corpus <- sento_corpus(usnews)
lexicons <- sento_lexicons(list_lexicons[c("GI_en", "LM_en", "HENRY_en")])
ctr <- ctr_agg(howWithin = "counts",
               howDocs = "proportional",
               howTime = c("linear", "equal_weight"), by = "week", lag = 14)

measures <- sento_measures(corpus, lexicons, ctr)

measuresGlobal <- aggregate(measures, do.global = TRUE)
measuresGlobal
```

The output in this case is not a specific **`sentometrics`** `sento_measures` object, but a `data.table` object. Below produces a nice plot using the **`ggplot2`** package.

```{r}
ggplot(melt(measuresGlobal, id.vars = "date")) +
  aes(x = date, y = value, color = variable) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_date(name = "Date", date_labels = "%m-%Y") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Sentiment") +
  theme_bw() + 
  sentometrics:::plot_theme(legendPos = "top") # a trick to finetune the plot display
```
