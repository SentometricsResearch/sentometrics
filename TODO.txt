TO DO
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- write unit tests
- examples < 5s. ==> otherwise don't run > bring down time for R CMD check + package size (< 5 Mb <=> data)
- check ### in-code
- add run_vignette.R script + vignette to repo
- open up GitHub + merge project page with central repo
- pass R CMD check

(check compatibility with major quanteda package update in October 2017)
(valence words not detected if first word is a valence shifter, e.g. " not " if text is "not ...")
(add IC/df estimator appropriate for logistic regression in elastic net-context; cf. Keven on GitHub)
(function to update sentomeasures [when new texts come in])
(allow transition from corpora of other text mining packages to our's [cf. quanteda's conversion functions] + feature inclusion)
(interface with lexicon package for access to more lexicons?)
(sentiment analysis for multiple languages at same time
	==> language features + deletion of wrong lexicon--language combo's + allow multi-language valence shifters (merge?))
(implement attribution_lags(); handle when fill is "latest" + aggregation across documents per lag needs to be known)
(make examples via built-in fitted data objects as data sets)
(more advanced sentiment calculation + ability to add own sentiment calculation function?)
