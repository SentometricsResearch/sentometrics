TO DO
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- check ### in-code
- open up GitHub + merge project page with central repo + add vignette (+ script) + clean GitHub (issues)
- pass R CMD check (1. registerSymbols... + timing of examples)
- check compatibility with major quanteda package update, and update all used packages
- check calibration (e.g. df calculation); why alpha set to 0 even if 0.5 clearly better?
- cut down + update project page

FUTURE:
- valence words not detected if first word is a valence shifter, e.g. " not " if text is "not ..."
- add IC/df estimator appropriate for logistic regression in elastic net-context; cf. Keven on GitHub
- function to update sentomeasures [when new texts come in]
- allow transition from corpora of other text mining packages to our's [cf. quanteda's conversion functions] + feature inclusion
- interface with lexicon package for access to more lexicons?
- sentiment analysis for multiple languages at same time
	==> language features + deletion of wrong lexicon--language combo's + allow multi-language valence shifters (merge?)
- implement attribution_lags(); handle when fill is "latest" + aggregation across documents per lag needs to be known
- more advanced sentiment calculation + ability to add own sentiment calculation function?
- do.ignoreZeros ==> discriminate between when 0 because feature-weight is 0 or sentiment is 0
