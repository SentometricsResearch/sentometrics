## sentometrics 0.8.0

- package update followed by release of a substantial update of the vignette (see https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3067734)
- added a clean error message when a document-level `sentiment` object not computed from a `sento_corpus` object is given to the `aggregate.sentiment()` function; the function now can also aggregate sentence-level `sentiment` objects without a `"date"` column
- changed some `warning()` calls to `message()` calls to be more kind to the user
- altered internal code to comply with **`quanteda`**'s >= v2.0 corpus object
- dropped all `"TF"`-like weights for within-document aggregation except for `"TFIDF"`, and made sure it gives the same sentiment scores as would come from using the `**quanteda**` package (cf. an example on https://sborms.github.io/sentometrics/)

## sentometrics 0.7.6

- fixed memory allocation issue in the `compute_sentiment()` function

## sentometrics 0.7.5

- new functions: `as.data.table.sento_corpus()`, `as.data.frame.sento_corpus()`, and `as.data.frame.sento_measures()`
- embedded a small workaround in the `plot.attributions()` function to guaranty same plotting behaviour after update of **`ggplot2`** package that gave buggy output for the `geom_area()` layer
- integrated for overall consistency the `measures_global()` function into the `aggregate.sento_measures()` function, adding a `do.global` argument to enact it
- slightly changed the clusters-based sentence-level sentiment computation (different weighting of
adversative conjunctions)
- clarified the documentation for the `peakdates()` and `peakdocs()` functions
- put the Shiny application made available in previous package update (i.e., the `sento_app()` function) in a separate sole-purpose package **`sentometrics.app`** (see https://github.com/sborms/sentometrics.app) 
- moved the **`data.table`** package from Depends to Imports (see https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/3076)
- no change by reference of input sentiment objects in the `merge.sentiment()` function anymore, and modified the merging to give for instance a simple column binding of sentment methods when all else is equal
- correct pass-through of default `how` argument in the `compute_sentiment()` function
- added a few adversative conjunctions to all word lists in `list_valence_shifters`
- added a `do.normalize` option to the `weights_beta()` and `weights_exponential()` functions
- added a `do.inverse` option to the `weights_exponential()` function and associated `do.inverseExp` argument in the `ctr_agg()` function
- modified some names of options for within-document or within-sentence aggregation (i.e., across tokens): `"squareRootCounts"` into `"proportionalSquareRoot"`, `"invertedExponential"` into `"inverseExponential"`, and `"invertedUShaped"` into `"inverseUShaped"`
- corrected the numerator (number of documents or sentences instead of token frequency) in all weighting schemes involving the inverse document frequency (IDF)
- aligned all formulas concerning the exponential weighting curves
- the `compute_sentiment()` function now also can do a sentence-level calculation using the bigrams valence shifting approach
- fixed a small bug that did not allow to have different valence shifters lists for a multi-language sentiment calculation

## sentometrics 0.7.0

- new functions: `measures_update()`, `subset.sento_measures()`, `as.sentiment()`, `as.sento_measures()`, `as.data.table.sentiment()`, `corpus_summarize()`, `sento_app()`, and `aggregate.sento_measures()`
- defunct all deprecated functions as well as the functions replaced by the new functions (_wiping the slate clean..._) 
- handled reverse dependency issue raised by **`quanteda`** developers regarding their new corpus object
- renamed the class objects coming from any `sento_xyz()` function into the name of the function (e.g., the `sento_measures()` function now gives a `sento_measures` object instead of a `sentomeasures` object)
- fixed a small bug in the `aggregate.sento_measures()` (previously `measures_merge()`) function to take the mean instead of the sum in a particular case
- added many more within- and across-document weighting schemes (see the `get_hows()` function for an overview)
- added the flexibility to do an explicit sentence-by-sentence sentiment computation (see `do.sentence` argument in the `compute_sentiment()` function)
- added the flexibility to create a multi-language `sento_corpus` object to do a multi-language sentiment computation (applying different lexicons to texts written in different languages)
- expanded the `compute_sentiment()` function to also take **`tm`** `SimpleCorpus` and `VCorpus` objects
- added the **`tm`** and **`NLP`** packages to Suggests

## sentometrics 0.5.5

- new functions: `sentiment_bind()`, and `to_sentiment()`

- solved single failing test for older R version (3.4.4)
- removed the **`abind`** package from Imports

- extended the `quanteda::docvars()` replacement method to a `sentocorpus` object
- modified information criterion estimators for edge cases to avoid them turning negative 
- dropped the `"x"` output element from a `sentomodel` object (for large samples, this became too memory consuming)
- dropped the `"howWithin"` output element from a `sentomeasures` object, and simplified a `sentiment` object into a `data.table` directly instead of a `list`
- expanded the `do.shrinkage.x` argument in the `ctr_model()` function to a vector argument
- added a `do.lags` argument to the `attributions()` function, to be able to circumvent the most time-consuming part of the computation 
- imposed a check in the `sento_measures()` function on the uniqueness of the names within and across the lexicons, features and time weighting schemes
- solved a bug in the `measures_merge()` function that made full merging not possible
- the `n` argument in the `peakdocs()` function can now also be specified as a quantile

- corrected update of `"attribWeights"` element of output `sentomeasures` object in required `measures_xyz()` functions
- added a new attribution dimension (`"lags"`) to the `attributions()` function, and corrected some edge cases

- replaced the `dfm` argument in the `compute_sentiment()` and `ctr_agg()` functions by a `tokens` argument, and altered the input and behaviour of the `nCore` argument in these same two functions
- switched from the **`quanteda`** package to the **`stringi`** package for more direct tokenization
- trimmed the `list_lexicons` and `list_valence_shifters` built-in word lists by keeping only unigrams, and included same trimming procedure in the `sento_lexicons()` function
- added a column type `"t"` to the `list_valence_shifters` built-in word list, and reset values of the `"y"` column from 2 to 1.8 and from 0.5 to 0.2
- updated the `epu` built-in dataset with the newest available series, up to July 2018

- dropped the `"tf-idf"` option for within-document aggregation in the `ctr_agg()` function
- the `sento_lexicons()` function outputs a `sentolexicons` object, which the `compute_sentiment()` function specifically requires as an input; a `sentolexicons` object also includes a `"["` class-preserving extractor function
- the `attributions()` function outputs an `attributions` object; the `plot_attribtutions()` function is therefore replaced by the `plot()` generic
- defunct the `perform_MCS()` function, but the output of the `get_loss_data()` function can easily be used as an input to the `MCSprocedure()` function from the **`MCS`** package (discarded from Imports)
- moved the **`parallel`** and **`doParallel`** packages to Suggests, as only needed (if enacted) in the `sento_model()` function
