\arguments{
\item{...}{arguments not documented since function declared defunct.}

\item{sentomeasures}{an appropriate \code{sentomeasures} object created using \code{\link{sento_measures}}.}

\item{fill}{an element of \code{c("zero", "latest", NA)}; the first and last assume missing dates represent zero sentiment,
the second assumes missing dates represent constant sentiment.}

\item{lexicons}{a \code{numeric} vector of weights, of size \code{length(sentomeasures$lexicons)}, in the same order.
By default set to 1, which means equally weighted.}

\item{features}{a \code{numeric} vector of weights, of size \code{length(sentomeasures$features)}, in the same order.
By default set to 1, which means equally weighted.}

\item{time}{a \code{numeric} vector of weights, of size \code{length(sentomeasures$time)}, in the same order. By default
set to 1, which means equally weighted.}

\item{subset}{a logical expression indicating the rows to keep.}

\item{toSelect}{a \code{character} vector of the lexicon, feature and time weighting scheme names, to indicate which
measures need to be selected, or as a \code{list} of \code{character} vectors, possibly with separately specified
combinations (only consisting of one lexicon, one feature, and one time weighting scheme at maximum).}

\item{lexiconsIn}{a named \code{list} of (raw) lexicons, each element as a \code{data.table} or a \code{data.frame} with
respectively a words column and a polarity score column. A subset of the already formatted built-in lexicons
accessible via \code{list_lexicons} should be passed here first.}

\item{valenceIn}{a single valence word list as a \code{data.table} or a \code{data.frame} with respectively a \code{"x"}
and a \code{"y"} or \code{"t"} column. The first column has the words, \code{"y"} has the values for bigram
shifting, and \code{"t"} has the types of the valence shifter for a clustered approach to sentiment calculation
(supported types: \code{1} = negators, \code{2} = amplifiers, \code{3} = deamplifiers). If three columns
are provided, the first two will be considered only. This argument can be one of the already formatted
built-in valence word lists accessible via \code{list_valence_shifters}. A word that appears in both a lexicon
and the valence word list is prioritized as a lexical entry during sentiment calculation. If \code{NULL}, no valence word
list is part of this function's output, and is thus not applied in the sentiment analysis.}

\item{do.split}{a \code{logical} that if \code{TRUE} splits every lexicon into a separate positive polarity and negative
polarity lexicon.}

\item{model}{a \code{sentomodel} or \code{sentomodeliter} object created with \code{\link{sento_model}}.}

\item{do.normalize}{a \code{logical}, \code{TRUE} divides each element of every attribution vector at a given date by its
L2-norm at that date, normalizing the values between -1 and 1. The document attributions are not normalized. Or, for
\code{\link{almons}}, if \code{TRUE}, then polynomials should be normalized to unity.}

\item{refDates}{the dates (as \code{"yyyy-mm-dd"}) at which attribution is to be performed. These should be between the latest
date available in the input \code{sentomeasures} object and the first estimation sample date (that is, \code{model$dates[1]}
if \code{model} is a \code{sentomodel} object). All dates should also be in \code{get_dates(sentomeasures)}. If
\code{NULL} (default), attribution is calculated for all in-sample dates. Ignored if \code{model} is a \code{sentomodeliter}
object, for which attribution is calculated for all out-of-sample prediction dates.}

\item{factor}{the factor level as a single \code{character} vector for which attribution has to be calculated in
case of (a) multinomial model(s). Ignored for linear and binomial models.}

\item{sentiment}{output from a \code{\link{compute_sentiment}} call, computed from a \code{sentocorpus} object.}

\item{ctr}{output from a \code{\link{ctr_agg}} call. The \code{howWithin} and \code{nCore} elements are ignored.}

\item{attributions}{an \code{attributions} object created with \code{\link{attributions}}.}

\item{group}{a value from \code{c("lags", "lexicons", "features", "time")}.}

\item{orders}{a \code{numeric} vector as the sequence of the Almon orders (cf., \emph{b}). The maximum value
corresponds to \emph{B}.}

\item{do.inverse}{\code{TRUE} if the inverse Almon polynomials should be calculated as well.}

\item{alphas}{a \code{numeric} vector of decay factors.}

\item{...}{(other) allowed input arguments.}
