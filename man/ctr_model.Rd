\usage{
ctr_model(model = c("lm", "nlm"), type = c("BIC", "cv"), h = 1,
  lambdas = 10^seq(2, -2, length.out = 50), alphas = seq(0.05, 0.95, by =
  0.1), nSample = NULL, trainWindow = NULL, oos = 0, do.iter = FALSE,
  start = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{a character vector indicator "\code{lm}" (linear model) or "\code{nlm}" (nonlinear model).}

\item{type}{a character vector indicating which model selection criteria to use. Currently supports "\code{BIC}" (BIC-like
criterion, cf. Zou, Hastie, Tibshirani, et al. (2007). "On the 'degrees of freedom' of the LASSO.") and "\code{cv}"
(cross-validation based on the \code{train} function from the \pkg{caret} package).}

\item{h}{a non-negative integer value to shift the time series to have the desired (forecasting) setup, \code{h == 0} means
no change to input data, \code{h > 0} shifts the dependent variable by \code{h} periods, \code{h < 0} shifts the independent
variables by \code{h} rows.}

\item{lambdas}{a numeric vector of the different lambdas to test for during optimization.}

\item{alphas}{a numeric vector of the different alphas to test for during optimization, between 0 and 1.}

\item{nSample}{a positive integer, size of the sample for model calibration at every iteration (ignored if
\code{iter == FALSE})}

\item{trainWindow}{a positive integer of the size of the training sample in the cross-validation (ignored if \code{type !=}
"\code{cv}")}

\item{oos}{a non-negative integer to indicate the number of periods to skip from the end of the cross-validation training
sample (out-of-sample) up to the test sample (ignored if \code{type !=} "\code{cv}")}

\item{do.iter}{a logical, \code{TRUE} will induce an iterative optimization of models through time.}

\item{start}{a positive integer to indicate at which point the iteration has to start (ignored if \code{iter == FALSE})}
}
\value{
A list encapsulating the control parameters.

\description{
Sets up control for linear or nonlinear modelling of a response variable onto a sparse panel of
textual sentiment measures (and potentially other variables). Models are computed using the elastic-net regularization
as implemented in the \pkg{glmnet} package, to account for the sparsity of the textual sentiment measures.
