\title{Plot prediction attributions at specified level}
\usage{
\method{plot}{attributions}(x, group = "features", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an \code{attributions} object created with \code{\link{attributions}}.}

\item{group}{a value from \code{c("lags", "lexicons", "features", "time")}.}

\item{...}{not used.}
}
\value{
Returns a simple \code{\link{ggplot}} object, which can be added onto (or to alter its default elements) by using
the \code{+} operator. By default, a legend is positioned at the top if the number of components of the
dimension is at maximum twelve.
}
\description{
Shows a plot of the attributions along the dimension provided, stacked per date.
}
\details{
See \code{\link{sento_model}} for an elaborate modeling example including the calculation and plotting of
attributions. This function does not handle the plotting of the attribution of individual documents, since there are
often a lot of documents involved and they appear only once at one date (even though a document may contribute to
predictions at several dates, depending on the number of lags in the time aggregation).
