## submission (version 0.3)

**new**: several additional functions and arguments, small bug fixes and clarifications in documentation 

- some examples modified to diminish elapsed time
- R depends now >= 3.3.0, dependency on sentimentr omitted
- marked UTF-8 strings will remain; this is intentional and comes from the built--in French (mostly) and Dutch word lists
