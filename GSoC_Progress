Who? SB

Wrote a sentiment calculation function:
	- based on the dfm() function from the quanteda package (for sentiment per words)
	- based on the sentiment() function from the sentimentr package (for sentiment per sentence)

wrote several functions which aggregate the output from above function:
	- aggregation across words, sentences, documents and time (to do: lexicons)

Tested above functions for a sample of the BELGA dataset consisting of 500 documents (cf. informal_testing.R)
	- went relatively smooth, however the calculation of sentiment itself will take quite some time for large corpora

Spent some time on the Shiny app (cf. SHINY (BELGA) folder)

Next up:
	- aggregation across lexicons
	- add filter function(s) for corpuS
	- add options and checks to functions currently written
	- incorporate functions in wrappers and enhanced integration
	- write down input requirements for users (e.g. input corpus but also sentiment values to aggregate)
	- further testing on larger dataset
