Description: The sentometrics package is designed to do time series analysis based
  on textual sentiment. It accounts for the intrinsic challenge that for a given text
  sentiment can be computed in hundreds of different ways, as well as the large number
  of possibilities to pool sentiment across text and time. This additional layer of
  manipulation does not exist in standard time series analysis packages. As a final
  outcome, this package provides an automated means to econometrically model the impact
  of sentiment in texts on a given variable, by optimizing the sentiment extraction and
  aggregation for the forecasting task. Aggregation can be optimized across several
  dimensions, for example word term weighting schemes or time lag structures. The package
  created therefore integrates the qualification of sentiment from text, the aggregation
  into different sentiment measures and the optimized forecasting based on these measures.
