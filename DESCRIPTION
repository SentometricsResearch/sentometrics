Description: Time series analysis based on textual sentiment, accounting for the intrinsic challenge that sentiment can be computed and pooled across texts and time in many ways. Provides a means to model the impact of sentiment in texts on a target variable, by first computing a wide range of textual sentiment measures and then selecting those that are most informative.
