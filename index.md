### What?

The **`sentometrics`** package offers an **integrated framework for textual sentiment time series aggregation and prediction**. It accounts for the intrinsic challenge that textual sentiment can be computed in many different ways, as well as the large number of possibilities to pool sentiment into a time series index. The package integrates the fast _quantification_ of sentiment from texts, the _aggregation_ into different sentiment time series, and the _prediction_ based on these measures. All in one coherent workflow! Explore this package website to learn about what you can do and how so.
